        * Bank:
        *   Add a new branch
        *   Add a customer to that branch with initial transaction
        *   Show a list of customers for a particular branch and optionally a list of their transactions
        * Demonstration autoboxing and unboxing in your code
        * Hint: Transaction
        * Add data validation
        * e.g. check if exists, or does not exist etc
        * Think about where you are adding the code to perform certain actions
